**`factory`** is a structured, type-safe source generation tool. It is intended to be a replacement for (and improvement over) the `gyb` tool!

`factory` is powered by [`swift-syntax`](https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax), so it evolves with the toolchain. **You cannot run it with the 5.6.2 release toolchain**, because the 5.6.2 toolchain is too old and does not support the API `factory` needs to transform your sources safely. 

The current toolchain pin is: 

[**`swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2022-08-15-a`**](https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/tags)

Swift files *generated* by `factory` are still backwards compatible, in fact one of the main use cases of `factory` is back-deployment.

## Overview 

`factory` was designed with the following goals in mind:

1.  Template files should look like normal `.swift` files, so highlighters and IDEs donâ€™t freak out. 

2.  Templates should be **safe**, and prohibit arbitrary string splicing or token substitutions.

3.  Templates should work well with documentation comments.

4.  Template syntax should be minimal, purely additive, and source generation tooling should accept and return vanilla `.swift` sources unchanged.

5.  Template users should be able to use as much or as little templating as they like, and using templating on one declaration should not increase the cognitive burden of the rest of the code in the file.

6.  Templating systems should nudge users towards using **the least amount of templating necessary** for their use-case.

7.  Template sources should be self-explanatory, and understandable by developers who have never heard of `swift-package-factory`.

8.  Template users should be able to *stop* using a templating system, and be able to assume responsibility for maintaining generated `.swift` files at any time.
